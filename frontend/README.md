## Development server

**Author**: David Morris  

**Development Time**: ~3 hours  To start a local development server, run:

**Framework**: Angular 17 (Standalone Components)  

**Design System**: DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency)```bash

ng serve

---```



## 🎯 Frontend OverviewOnce the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.



This Angular 17 application provides a comprehensive user interface for federal regulations analysis, built specifically for government efficiency and DOGE principles. The frontend demonstrates modern web development capabilities while maintaining professional government design standards.## Code scaffolding

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enhanced type safety and error prevention## Building

- **Reactive Programming**: RxJS observables for API integration

- **Lazy Loading**: Component-based routing with code splittingTo build the project run:



### **Design & User Experience**```bash

- **DOGE Design System**: Official orange/dark theme with professional stylingng build

- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first CSS Grid/Flexbox implementation```

- **Interactive Elements**: Loading states, hover effects, form validation

- **Video Integration**: Hero video backgrounds for enhanced visual appealThis will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.



### **Government Standards**## Running unit tests

- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML with keyboard navigation support

- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size with tree shakingTo execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

- **Cross-Browser**: Compatible with government-standard browsers

- **Security**: Input sanitization and XSS prevention```bash

ng test

---```



## 🚀 Development Setup## Running end-to-end tests



### **Prerequisites**For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

- Node.js 18+ and npm

- Angular CLI 17+```bash

- Backend running on localhost:8081ng e2e

```

### **Installation & Startup**

```bashAngular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
