# USDS Regulations Analysis Backend

A comprehensive Spring Boot application for federal regulations analysis, relationship detection, and conflict identification across all 50 CFR titles.

## Project Intent

This project was developed as a **Federal Regulations Analysis System** to address critical challenges in regulatory compliance and oversight. The system provides:

- **Comprehensive Data Coverage**: Analysis across all 50 CFR titles (General Services, Agriculture, Energy, FDA, EPA, etc.)
- **Relationship Detection**: Automated identification of regulatory redundancies, conflicts, and dependencies
- **Conflict Analysis**: Multi-level severity assessment (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) for regulatory conflicts
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for future expansion into regulatory impact analysis, compliance tracking, and policy recommendations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed analytics on regulatory relationships, amendment tracking, and system-wide conflict summaries

## Technical Evolution & Data Challenges

### Initial Implementation
The project began with eCFR API integration for real-time federal regulation data retrieval. However, significant technical challenges emerged:

### API Access Issues
- **CAPTCHA Blocking**: The primary eCFR domain (www.ecfr.gov) implemented CAPTCHA protection that blocked automated access
- **Rate Limiting**: Strict API rate limits hindered bulk data collection across 50 CFR titles
- **Data Inconsistency**: Incomplete content, missing amendment dates, and inconsistent formatting
- **Authentication Requirements**: Evolving API authentication requirements for production-scale access

### Technical Debt & Design Decisions

**Current Technical Debt:**
1. **Mock Data Dependency**: System currently relies on realistic mock data generation instead of live eCFR API
2. **H2 Database**: Using in-memory H2 for development; production would require PostgreSQL migration
3. **Single-Instance Architecture**: No horizontal scaling or distributed processing capabilities
4. **Limited Error Recovery**: Basic error handling for API failures and data inconsistencies

**Architectural Decisions:**
- **MockDataService**: Generates realistic regulatory content (200-500 words) with varied section structures
- **Relationship Detection**: Advanced similarity algorithms for identifying regulatory connections
- **Auto-Trigger System**: Automated workflow eliminating manual relationship detection steps
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit trails for regulatory analysis and conflict detection

## Features

- **Multi-Title Regulation Management**: All 50 CFR titles with realistic content generation
- **Advanced Relationship Detection**: 7 relationship types (REDUNDANT, CONFLICTING, COMPLEMENTARY, SUPERSEDING, REFERENCED, OVERLAPPING, DEPENDENT)
- **Conflict Severity Analysis**: 4-level severity classification with automated scoring
- **Auto-Trigger Workflows**: Single API call generates data and detects relationships automatically
- **Analytics Dashboard**: System-wide statistics, conflict summaries, and performance metrics
- **Amendment Tracking**: Historical change detection and government source date tracking

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- H2 Database (embedded - no setup required)
- Optional: PostgreSQL 12+ for production deployment

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and navigate to the backend directory:**
```bash
cd backend
```

2. **Build and run the application:**
```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/regulations-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8081` with H2 console at `http://localhost:8081/h2-console`

### H2 Database Console Access

- **Password**: (leave empty)

## API Endpoints for Technical Evaluation

### üöÄ Primary Workflow - Auto-Trigger System

**Generate Mock Data + Auto-Detect Relationships (Recommended)**
```bash
# Generate 3 regulations per title across all 50 CFR titles + auto-detect relationships
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/generate-mock-data-all-titles-with-relationships/3

# Quick test with 2 regulations per title
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/generate-mock-data-all-titles-with-relationships/2
```

**Expected Results in H2 Console:**
- Navigate to `REGULATIONS` table ‚Üí 150 (or 100) regulations across 50 titles
- Navigate to `REGULATION_RELATIONSHIPS` table ‚Üí 100+ detected relationships
- Observe varied content lengths, realistic regulatory language, and relationship types

### üìä Analytics & Statistics

**System-Wide Analytics**
```bash
# Comprehensive system statistics

## H2 Console Evaluation Guide

### 1. Primary Tables to Examine

**REGULATIONS Table**
```sql
SELECT id, agency_name, cfr_title, amendment_count, word_count, created_at 
FROM regulations 
ORDER BY cfr_title, id;
```

**REGULATION_RELATIONSHIPS Table**  
```sql
SELECT source_regulation_id, target_regulation_id, relationship_type, 
       conflict_severity, similarity_score, created_at
FROM regulation_relationships 
ORDER BY similarity_score DESC;
```

### 2. Key Analytics Queries

**Relationship Type Distribution**
```sql
SELECT relationship_type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM regulation_relationships 
GROUP BY relationship_type 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Conflict Severity Analysis**
```sql
SELECT conflict_severity, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM regulation_relationships 
WHERE relationship_type = 'CONFLICTING'
GROUP BY conflict_severity;
```

**Cross-Title Relationship Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
    r1.cfr_title as source_title,
    r2.cfr_title as target_title,
    rr.relationship_type,
    COUNT(*) as relationship_count
FROM regulation_relationships rr
JOIN regulations r1 ON rr.source_regulation_id = r1.id
JOIN regulations r2 ON rr.target_regulation_id = r2.id
WHERE r1.cfr_title != r2.cfr_title
GROUP BY r1.cfr_title, r2.cfr_title, rr.relationship_type
ORDER BY relationship_count DESC;
```

### 3. Testing Scenarios

1. Generate data for Agriculture (7), EPA (40), and FDA (21)
2. Detect cross-title relationships
3. Examine COMPLEMENTARY and OVERLAPPING relationships
4. Review similarity scores and conflict patterns
